# Module 1 Challenge

Use given starter code to optimize HTML and CSS for accessibility standards, implementing semantic elements.

## User Story

* AS A marketing agency

* I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards

* SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

* WHEN I view the source code

* THEN I find semantic HTML elements

* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

* WHEN I view the image elements

* THEN I find accessible alt attributes

* WHEN I view the heading attributes

* THEN they fall in sequential order

* WHEN I view the title element

* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Notes

I changed the title to fit the name of the firm.

I replaced div tags with relevant semantic tags so they make better sense.

I added alt descriptions for images for accessibility standards.

I ensured that the coding was cleaned up in order for the nav bar to correctly redirect user from "Search Engine Optimization" to relevant section on page.

I changed the h2 tag to h3 in footer so that an h2 was not below h3 within the HTML.

I consolidated the CSS code to eliminate redundancies.
